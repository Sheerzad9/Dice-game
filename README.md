# Dice-game
## Rules of the game
In this game are 2 players, and the players are supposed to gain >= 100 points before the other player. Player 1 will start the game by rolling the dice, if the eye count is > 1 
you can deposit the score in your bank (after the deposit it's the other players turn to roll the dice) or you can roll the dice again to gain more point. If the eye count is 1, 
you will lose all your undeposited scores and then it's the other players turn to roll the dice, this will go on until one of the players have managed to gain 100 points.
